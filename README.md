## Description

University of Minnesota Coding Boot Camp - Full Stack Live Online Program.

This Study Guide contains prework notes regarding HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

The ultimate goal of this prework Study Guide is to introduce some of the concepts we'll be learning more about during the boot camp, and to level-set all of the incoming boot camp participants to a minimium base knowledge level.
